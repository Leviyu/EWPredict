# EWPredict

The goal of this project is to utilize machine learning algorithms to catagorize seismic records based on information produced by [Empirical Wavelet Method](https://github.com/Leviyu/EQTime). 

Being able to automatically predict the quality (accept or reject) of seismic record combined with Empriical Wavelet Making mathod would allows us to build seismic dataset in a fast, systematical and consistant manner. And being able to do so, would allow us to establish first step towards a new era for seismology.
